Glycol Production Reactor/Kinetic Information 

 

Ethylene and propylene glycol can be produced by the hydrolysis of ethylene or propylene 
oxide. For ethylene oxide the reaction is: 

 

 CH2CH2CH2CH2OHOHOHO2+

 

In most industrial processes the ethylene/propylene oxide is thermally hydrolyzed in a liquid 
phase reaction to ethylene glycol without a catalyst. The ethylene/propylene oxide and water 
mixture is preheated to 150-200ºC at an elevated pressure before feeding to a reactor. 

 

Ethylene/propylene oxide can also readily react with ethylene/propylene glycol to produce di-
, tri- and polyethylene/polypropylene glycols. The formation of these undesired side products 
is minimized by carrying out the reaction with a large excess of water. A 20-fold molar 
excess of water is typically employed. In addition plug-flow reactors are superior to stirred-
tank reactors for selectively producing ethylene/propylene glycol. Finally the conversion of 
ethylene/propylene oxide should not exceed 80% to maintain the formation of 
polyethylene/polypropylene glycols to a negligible level. 

 

The reactions are exothermic, however due to the large excess of water used the adiabatic 
temperature increase is small. As a result the reactor can usually be operated without cooling 
to control the temperature.

Since the reaction is carried out with a large excess of water, the reaction rate can be 
considered to be pseusdo first order with respect to the ethylene oxide concentration. The rate 
expression is:
